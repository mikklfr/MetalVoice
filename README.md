## ✨ Features

*   **🚫 Silence the Noise**: Instantly removes fans, typing, air conditioning, and background chatter.
*   **🗣️ Studio Clarity**: De-reverberation clears up "roomy" echoes, making you sound like you're in a studio.
*   **⚡ Zero Latency Feel**: Optimized Metal pipeline ensures negligible delay tailored for real-time communication.
*   **🔒 Privacy First**: 100% On-Device. Your voice is processed locally on your Neural Engine. No data leaves your Mac.
*   **🛠️ Universal**: Works with **any** microphone (USB, XLR, Built-in) and outputs to **any** app via virtual cables.

## 📥 Installation

1.  **Download**: Get the latest version from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Ghostkwebb/MetalVoice/releases/latest).
2.  **Unzip**: Extract `MetalVoice_v1.1.zip`. Inside, you'll find the GUI `MetalVoice.app` and the terminal `MetalVoiceCLI`.
3.  **Install**: Drag `MetalVoice.app` to your **Applications** folder.
4.  **Open**: Right-click and choose **Open** (necessary for the first launch to verify the developer).
    *   *Note: If prompted about "Malicious Software", go to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Open Anyway.*

### GUI - Single Pipeline (Default)

1.  **Launch**: Look for the **Waveform Icon 🌊** in your menu bar.
2.  **Select Input**: Click the gear ⚙️ icon. Set **Input Device** to your physical microphone.
3.  **Select Output**: Set **Output Device** to a Virtual Audio Cable (Recommended: **[BlackHole 2ch](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)**).
    *   *This routes the "Clean" audio into the cable.*
4.  **Configure Apps**: inside Discord/Zoom/OBS, set your **Microphone Input** to that same Virtual Cable (e.g., BlackHole 2ch).
5.  **Enable AI**: Toggle the switch **ON** in the MetalVoice menu. Enjoy crystal clear audio!

### GUI - Dual Pipelines (Pro)

Need to filter your microphone **AND** filter your colleagues' audio at the same time?

1.  **Open Settings**: Click the gear ⚙️ icon and navigate to the **Pipelines** tab.
2.  **Create Second Pipeline**: Click the **+** button to add a second pipeline.
3.  **Configure First Pipeline**: 
    *   Input: Your microphone (e.g., "Built-in Microphone")
    *   Output: Virtual Cable (e.g., "BlackHole 2ch")
4.  **Configure Second Pipeline**:
    *   Input: Your incoming audio source (e.g., "Loopback Audio" or meeting app audio)
    *   Output: Your speakers (e.g., "MacBook Pro Speakers")
5.  **Enable Both**: Toggle the switch **ON** in both pipeline rows.
6.  **Result**: Both input sources are now noise-filtered independently!

## 💻 Advanced: Dual Pipelines (CLI)

Need to filter your microphone for your meeting, AND filter your colleagues' audio coming into your headphones? Use the included CLI to run multiple independent pipelines:

1. Copy `MetalVoiceCLI` from the zip to a convenient folder.
2. Open Terminal 1 (Clean Your Mic):
   ```bash
   ./MetalVoiceCLI --in "Built-in Microphone" --out "BlackHole 2ch" --name "Microphone" --gain 1.0
   ```
3. Open Terminal 2 (Clean Your Meeting):
   ```bash
   ./MetalVoiceCLI --in "Loopback Audio" --out "MacBook Pro Speakers" --name "Meeting Audio" --gain 1.5
   ```

Each terminal runs a completely independent AI pipeline with its own:
- Input device selection
- Output device selection
- Noise suppression processing
- Gain adjustment

**Why use CLI for dual pipelines?** The CLI approach allows unlimited independent pipelines (2+ simultaneously), while the GUI supports up to 2 pipelines managed from one window.


## 💻 Tech Stack

*   **Core**: Swift 5, SwiftUI
*   **Audio**: AVFoundation, Accelerate (vDSP)
*   **AI Engine**: CoreML + Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
*   **Model**: [DeepFilterNet3](https://github.com/Rikorose/DeepFilterNet) (Streaming UNet)

## 🙏 Credits

*   **DeepFilterNet**: Developed by [Hendrik Schröter (Rikorose)](https://github.com/Rikorose). DeepFilterNet is one of the most efficient noise suppression models available. MetalVoice uses a custom CoreML implementation of this architecture.
*   **Icons**: SF Symbols by Apple.
